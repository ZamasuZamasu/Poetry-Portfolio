# About the project
This is a portfolio for my poetry work. I've used some of my written poems along with my own ideas to create this website.

This website consists of three webpages : 

- Index or the Home Page
- Poems [List of all poems] page
- Individual webpages of each poem I've put in this project
- Contacts Page


## The Index Page

It has three main sections :
- Header: I've used a multi-colored design pattern, using css, which gives it a immaculate glassy, yet a vibrant look. The navigation bar is located just below the Title of the webpage, and contains three navigations links to the three main webpages.

- main: The Body consists of poem cards created using div and styled using css's poem-grid attribute. The grid has been adjusted to feature only four cards in one block. These four cards feature some of the best poems out of a few I've used in this project. Further, I've also designed the "About the poet" section which gives a brief introduction about myself.

- footer: Features a glossy black design, and contains logos of various social media which directs to my social profiles. The "Move to Top" button uses Javascript to move the user to the top of the webpage.


## The Poems Page and the Poems

### Poems Page
- The header and footer are the same, and the main portion of the page consists of links to all the poems used in this project. The design features usage of smaller cards for each poem name, and hoverable with shadow effects using css.

### Poems

- Each poem has been designed in a seperate webpage with similar header and footers, and the main portion consisting of the content itself.


## Contacts Page
- Similar header and footers, and main portion contains social links and contact number to reach out to the poet.



# Use of Programming Languages
HTML: For basic structure of all webpages, the layout of header, main and footer, the required links, texts and pretexts.
CSS: Styling All webpages.
Javascript: Minimally used for the "Move to Top" feature of each webpage's footer.
