            <div class="stanza">
                <p>A smile from without,<br>
                But a cry from within,<br>
                I felt shattered with a question of,<br>
                How it happened to me?</p>
            </div>

            <div class="stanza">
                <p>Too much support from outside,<br>
                Yet I could avail none,<br>
                Had a couple of breakdowns,<br>
                But couldn't shed a tear in any one.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="stanza">
                <p>I reminisce, being alone,<br>
                Even though I wasn't,<br>
                Trying to scream, yell, suffocate,<br>
                But all in vain.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="stanza">
                <p>Thoughts of ending myself,<br>
                flashed through my mind,<br>
                But the guilt of making my dear ones sad,<br>
                Forbade me from this act.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="stanza">
                <p>Felt confused, agitated, aghast,<br>
                Beautiful dreams turned into nightmares,<br>
                Loving someone was a remedy,<br>
                But for me it turned to be a poison.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="stanza">
                <p>When I lost hope of everything,<br>
                Things started getting worse and worse,<br>
                Suddenly I crossed paths with someone,<br>
                And my situation turned.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="stanza">
                <p>I met the light,<br>
                which rekindled my spirits,<br>
                A few lucky moments of conversations,<br>
                Removed all the fright.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="stanza">
                <p>Things got better with time,<br>
                Thanks to that optimistic light,<br>
                I found back my rhythm, and broke throught my nightmares,<br>
                To dream peacefully, with a hope of getting better.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="stanza">
                <p>Once felt bad, now its getting fine,<br>
                Not cent percent, but still better than an year before,<br>
                But I believe I'll be the best soon,<br>
                And show what I am worth of.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="stanza">
                <p>Now I'm at present, chasing a dream,<br>
                All away from those midnight scream,<br>
                And that's how I end, with an advice<br>
                Don't hide your feelings, for you'll have 'tearless' cry.</p>
