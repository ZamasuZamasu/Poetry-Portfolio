            <div class="stanza">
                <p>Long, long ago,<br>
                We crossed paths with each other,<br>
                And fell in love, and showered ourselves with affection,<br>
                Like no other.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="stanza">
                <p>We travelled through this journey,<br>
                Full of ups and downs,<br>
                Holding hands together,<br>
                Broke through all the obstacles that tried to break us.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="stanza">
                <p>"I care for you and you love me"<br>
                These words were our feelings<br>
                "When I fell down, you pushed me up"<br>
                That's how we inspired each other.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="stanza">
                <p>We stood the test of time,<br>
                Bad things came to move us apart,<br>
                But our love was too strong for it<br>
                To break us and move apart.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="stanza">
                <p>"You were my blessing, and my muse"<br>
                That's what we think about each other<br>
                "I think God blessed me with you"<br>
                Our thought say this to each other.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="stanza">
                <p>Love is a feeling, an emotion,<br>
                Empowered with support, care, happiness,<br>
                And we found these all in our lives,<br>
                The bond we shared, gave us all of it, to cherish.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="stanza">
                <p>From childhood friendship to young love,<br>
                From childish feelings, to "Love forever" memories,<br>
                Our love evolved,<br>
                We grew up, became aged, lost our outward beauty,<br>
                But what never changed, in fact,<br>
                Even grew more and more, is our love.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="stanza">
                <p>As we go through this amazing journey of life,<br>
                Let's put those sad feelings of adversities aside,<br>
                And look forward to Illumine our lives,<br>
                With forever cherishing and mesmerizing happiness.</p>
