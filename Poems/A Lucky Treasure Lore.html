            <div class="stanza">
                <p>Once lived a poor man in durn,<br>
                Sold flowers to feed and earn,<br>
                For himself and his family.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="stanza">
                <p>A stable life is what he yearned,<br>
                "Alas! It's of no avail!" is what he learned.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="stanza">
                <p>Worked hard to pull through his impoverished state<br>
                Though his hapless life was a tragic bait.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="stanza">
                <p>A vicious circle of hard work for more money<br>
                and more work for no money.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="stanza">
                <p>One night he was all alone,<br>
                Prayed to God with cries of sorrow,</p>
            </div>

            <div class="stanza">
                <p>To reward his honesty and help him thrive,<br>
                Or take everything with his life.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="stanza">
                <p>"Nothing more than happiness I wish for",<br>
                "Without it it's worthless to live long"</p>
            </div>

            <div class="stanza">
                <p>That night he slept teary eyed,<br>
                Hapless to witness another night.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="stanza">
                <p>The next day, he woke up as usual,<br>
                Going out for his job,</p>
            </div>

            <div class="stanza">
                <p>He noticed something unusual,<br>
                That old tree beside their hut,</p>
            </div>

            <div class="stanza">
                <p>With an intact bark till yesterday,<br>
                Had a burrow in it today,</p>
            </div>

            <div class="stanza">
                <p>Perplexed, went to look into what lies in it,<br>
                No animal, but a paper lies in it.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="stanza">
                <p>Unfolded to see a map drawn,<br>
                With a cross mounted at a lawn,</p>
            </div>

            <div class="stanza">
                <p>Lying on the other side of hills,<br>
                The adventurous location gave this man some thrills,</p>
            </div>

            <div class="stanza">
                <p>Out of curiosity,<br>
                followed the dreaded path of that strange map,</p>
            </div>

            <div class="stanza">
                <p>Reached the lawn, abandoned by most people of the land,<br>
                Nervous yet obstinate, traversed the entire lawn,</p>
            </div>

            <div class="stanza">
                <p>Found a small place, quite seclude,<br>
                Yet it allured, the man with excitement,</p>
            </div>

            <div class="stanza">
                <p>It had the cross,<br>
                The same place which the map pointed.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="stanza">
                <p>Yet the man couldn't get the clue,<br>
                Until something struck him out of the blue.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="stanza">
                <p>Looked down, a weird object he saw,<br>
                Stuck in the ground,</p>
            </div>

            <div class="stanza">
                <p>With full force, he pulled it out,<br>
                It was a box, quite heavy and old,</p>
            </div>

            <div class="stanza">
                <p>No limits to curiosity,<br>
                Opened it up, jumped with joy,</p>
            </div>

            <div class="stanza">
                <p>The box had priceless load of gold coins!<br>
                Cried with happiness,</p>
            </div>

            <div class="stanza">
                <p>For he longed for these priceless things,<br>
                Woohoo, and that changed everything!</p>
